# Notesheet — Spreadsheets for Joplin

Notesheet turns a Joplin note into a real spreadsheet. Powered by the [Univer SDK](https://github.com/dream-num/univer), it gives Joplin first-class support for formulas, formatting, sorting, filtering, named tables, and `.xlsx` import/export — all inside the note editor pane you already use.

## Features

- **Spreadsheet inside any note.** A new "New Spreadsheet" command (Tools menu, toolbar button, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S`) creates a note that opens directly in a Univer-powered spreadsheet editor. Persistence, sync, and full-text search all use Joplin's normal note storage.
- **Formulas, formatting, sort, filter** — out of the box via Univer's standard toolbar.
- **Named tables** — Insert Table from the Data ribbon; right-click inside a table for row/column insert/remove.
- **`.xlsx` import/export** — floating Import/Export buttons in the editor view, plus a Tools menu command "Import .xlsx as Notesheet" that creates a new note from a `.xlsx` file. Round-trips values, formulas, fonts, fills, alignment, number formats, and merged cells.

> **Note on charts:** Univer's chart packages (`@univerjs-pro/sheets-chart`) are commercial / require a license server, so M7 will ship a custom integration with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (MIT) instead.

## How a Notesheet note is stored

A Spreadsheet note is a regular Joplin note whose body is a Univer snapshot wrapped in a fenced markdown code block tagged ```` ```notesheet ````:

```
```notesheet v=1
{ "id": "...", "sheetOrder": [...], "sheets": {...}, ... }
```
```

When the active note's body matches that shape, Joplin's editor pane shows the Univer editor instead of the markdown editor (via Joplin's [Custom Editor API](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplinviewseditor.html)). For any other note, the markdown editor opens normally — Notesheet adds zero overhead to non-spreadsheet notes.

The fence's `v=1` marker is a forward-compatibility hook so a future on-disk format change can dispatch by version.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dist     # builds the .jpl into publish/
npm test         # runs Jest unit tests
```

Requires Node.js 18+. The build produces `publish/com.kamleshnanda.joplin-notesheet.jpl`, which can be installed in Joplin via **Tools → Options → Plugins → ⚙ → Install from file**.

## Compatibility

- Joplin 3.5+
- Desktop only (Joplin Mobile's plugin model isn't yet ready for the Custom Editor API)

## License
