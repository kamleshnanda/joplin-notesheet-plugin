# Notesheet PGE — progress log

This file is the generator's session-to-session handoff. Update after
every feature.

## Done

- **feature-1-smoke-red-cell** (2026-06-02) — Generator inline-implemented
  the smoke seed in `src/snapshot.ts:emptySnapshot()`. A1 = "harness-smoke-OK"
  styled via `styles['pge-smoke-red'] = { cl: { rgb: '#FF0000' } }`,
  cell carries `s: 'pge-smoke-red'` reference. Built .jpl, installed in
  dev profile, captured generator-evidence screenshot showing red text
  rendered in Univer at A1. Fresh-context evaluator subprocess graded
  PASS (cd8bf51).
- **harness-hardening** (2026-06-02) — `eval-screenshot.js` now drops
  into the `UserWebviewIndex.html` frame inside the editor page (where
  Univer actually mounts) and waits on the real Univer canvas selector
  `canvas[id^="univer-sheet-main-canvas"]` instead of a 5s sleep.
  Emits a `<screenshot>.pixels.json` sidecar with the top non-background
  colours sampled from the row-0 canvas slab — gives evaluators a
  machine-checkable signal alongside the visual screenshot. Confirmed
  on the smoke note: dominant `rgb(234,237,249)` (header band),
  `rgb(255,0,0)` appears in top-3 with 353 hits, proving the red is
  real pixels not just snapshot data.
- **feature-1-m13-rotated-text-renders** (2026-06-03) — Cherry-picked
  the reverted PR #16 (`415b4a4`) rotation import/export in
  `src/xlsx.ts`, plus `tests/m13RotatedText.test.ts` and the
  `m12FixtureRoundTrip.test.ts` flips. README docs edit explicitly
  out-of-scope. Built .jpl, installed in dev profile, imported
  `MergedCellsAndAlignment.xlsx` headlessly via the new
  `scripts/pge/import-fixture.{ts,sh}`, captured canvas-targeted
  screenshot showing A6 up-right diagonal, B6 vertical, C6 down-right
  diagonal. Pixel sidecar over the rotated row band reports
  `inkRowSpread=1.000` (text ink occupies every sampled y-row in the
  slab) — strong non-horizontal signal independent of colour. Jest
  187/187 (was 181 baseline + 6 new rotation tests). The reverted
  code worked first try in Univer 0.23 — earlier visual failure was
  almost certainly a stale-build issue, not a rendering gap. Awaiting
  evaluator pass.

## In progress

(Empty between sessions.)

## Next

(Empty — pending evaluator verdict on feature-1-m13-rotated-text-renders.)

## Notes

- **`emptySnapshot()` is the seam.** It's the single function that
  produces a fresh workbook for both the New Spreadsheet command
  (src/index.ts:103) and any "load empty fence" path. Putting the
  smoke seed here meant Jest tests could pin it down without mocking
  the Joplin Data API.
- **Univer's style resolver requires the colour on `styles[id]`,
  not inline on the cell.** The cell carries `s: <id>` (not
  `s: { cl: ... }`) and `cl.rgb` must include the leading `#`. We
  documented this in the BUILD_PLAN risks block; M13 lessons confirm
  it.
- **Evaluator needs a SEEDED note, not a `{}` note.** The plugin's
  `extractSnapshot('{}'...)` succeeds on `{}` (valid JSON, valid object)
  and the editor loads an empty Univer workbook — bypassing
  `emptySnapshot()` entirely. The harness needs a note whose body is
  `wrapSnapshot(emptySnapshot())`. We added
  `scripts/pge/create-seeded-notesheet.js` for that; it duplicates
  the seed shape, which is intentional coupling (the harness is
  allowed to know what the runtime does).
- **CDP page picker.** Joplin's CDP exposes 4-5 pages: a DevTools
  page, plugin sandboxes (one per loaded plugin including ours), and
  the editor. eval-screenshot.js scores by URL/title; editor wins
  unambiguously (16 vs 11/0/0). Plugin sandbox pages are
  `<body></body>` — they host plugin process logic, NOT the editor
  view. Don't try to attach to them.
- **Univer mounts in `UserWebviewIndex.html`** (a frame of the editor
  page), not the plugin sandbox. Stable selectors (Univer 0.23):
    - `canvas[id^="univer-sheet-main-canvas"]` — the main spreadsheet
      canvas. Id is `univer-sheet-main-canvas_<workbookId>`.
    - `[class*="univer-flex"]` — the toolbar wrapper (appears slightly
      before the canvas).
    - `#joplin-plugin-content` — the Joplin webview wrapper (always
      present once the plugin loads).
- **Pixel sidecar (`.pixels.json`)** — the harness samples the
  Univer main canvas's top-80px row-0 slab and writes a histogram of
  non-background colours alongside the screenshot. Use it for
  machine-checkable assertions like "top contains rgb(255,0,0) > 50
  hits" instead of "I saw red." Sampling is stride-2 to keep cost
  cheap. Background (>235 in all channels) and gridline ink (<30)
  are filtered out.
- **Pre-existing `tests/exportTableRoundTrip.test.ts:334` typecheck
  bug** — `'dashed'` is not in exceljs `BorderStyle` enum. Changed
  to `'mediumDashed'` (with matching assertion update on line 349)
  during this session because webpack's TS check blocks .jpl build.
  This was unrelated to smoke; the smoke didn't introduce it.
- **`scripts/pge/import-fixture.{ts,sh}`** — headless equivalent of
  the plugin's "Import .xlsx as Notesheet" command. The .ts calls
  `xlsxBufferToSnapshot()` from `src/xlsx.ts` directly so the harness
  exercises the SAME conversion the plugin runs at runtime; the .sh
  wrapper compiles via `node_modules/.bin/tsc` to a temp dir and runs
  the JS through Node with `NODE_PATH` pointing at the repo's
  `node_modules`. `PGE_REPO_ROOT` env var is required because
  `__dirname` after compile lives inside the temp dir.
- **Joplin window pane crops the Univer canvas.** `page.screenshot()`
  with `fullPage:false` captures the whole Joplin window — but at
  Joplin's default pane sizes the editor pane is narrower than the
  Univer canvas, so the canvas is cropped or partially offscreen.
  Fixed in `eval-screenshot.js` by screenshotting the canvas element
  directly via `webview.locator(canvasSel).screenshot()` when a
  Notesheet note is opened. The whole-page screenshot is the
  fallback for smoke / verification mode.
- **`inkRowSpread` metric.** Added to the pixel sidecar:
  `inkRows / ceil(regionHeight/2)` — the fraction of sampled y-rows
  in the region that carry text-coloured ink. Horizontal text
  concentrates ink on a narrow band (low spread); rotated/stacked
  text spreads across the band (high spread, near 1.0). Use this
  alongside the colour histogram for rotation-style features.
- **`feature-1-m13-rotated-text-renders` worked first try in Univer
  0.23.** PR #16's `style.tr = { a: <angle> }` (and `{ a: 0, v: 1 }`
  for stacked) maps directly to Univer's `ITextRotation` and the
  resolver honours it without extra plugin registration. The earlier
  visual failure that prompted the revert was almost certainly a
  stale-build / cache-not-wiped issue, not a renderer-vs-shape
  mismatch. The harness's `install-plugin.sh` cache wipe + Joplin-
  quit gate is what makes the difference.
- **Region-by-feature pixel sampling.** `eval-screenshot.js` now
  consults `REGION_BY_FEATURE` and `TITLE_PREFIX_BY_FEATURE` tables
  to pick the right canvas region and note title prefix per feature.
  When adding a new feature whose evidence isn't on row 0, add a
  region helper (like `rotatedRowRegion`) and an entry in both
  tables.
- **Window prep is mandatory before evaluator screenshots.** Three
  pre-conditions had to be enforced after operator hit them:
    1. Joplin window must fill its display (not 800×568 or whatever
       the operator left it at) — Univer sizes its canvas to the
       editor pane, so a small window means fewer columns rendered
       and the visual gate may miss content.
    2. Sidebar (`.rli-sideBar`) and note list (`.note-list`) must be
       hidden — they consume ~500-700px of horizontal real estate
       the editor could otherwise use.
    3. Any DevTools window must be closed — it shrinks the renderer
       AND can confuse `eval-screenshot.js`'s CDP page picker.
  `scripts/pge/prep-joplin-window.sh` handles all three. AppleScript
  invokes `Window > Fill` and sends `Cmd+Alt+S` / `Cmd+Alt+L` for
  pane toggles (Playwright's `keyboard.press()` does NOT reach
  Joplin's Electron-accelerator-routed shortcuts — the renderer
  receives the keydown but the command never fires; OS-level
  System Events keystroke does work). State-aware: queries renderer
  DOM via `element.offsetParent !== null` (canonical for "any
  ancestor has display:none") and only toggles when needed. Wired
  into `eval-screenshot.sh` ahead of the screenshot. Requires
  Accessibility permission for the terminal app in System Settings.
