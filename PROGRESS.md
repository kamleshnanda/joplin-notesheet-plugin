# Notesheet PGE — progress log

This file is the generator's session-to-session handoff. Update after
every feature.

## Done

- **feature-1-smoke-red-cell** (2026-06-02) — Generator inline-implemented
  the smoke seed in `src/snapshot.ts:emptySnapshot()`. A1 = "harness-smoke-OK"
  styled via `styles['pge-smoke-red'] = { cl: { rgb: '#FF0000' } }`,
  cell carries `s: 'pge-smoke-red'` reference. Built .jpl, installed in
  dev profile, captured generator-evidence screenshot showing red text
  rendered in Univer at A1. End-to-end harness validated. Awaiting
  fresh-context evaluator verdict.

## In progress

(Empty between sessions.)

## Next

- Real M13 features (rich text, rotated text, conditional formatting)
  via the now-validated harness. The generator runs through `run-cycle.sh`
  for those — the smoke proved the loop works.

## Notes

- **`emptySnapshot()` is the seam.** It's the single function that
  produces a fresh workbook for both the New Spreadsheet command
  (src/index.ts:103) and any "load empty fence" path. Putting the
  smoke seed here meant Jest tests could pin it down without mocking
  the Joplin Data API.
- **Univer's style resolver requires the colour on `styles[id]`,
  not inline on the cell.** The cell carries `s: <id>` (not
  `s: { cl: ... }`) and `cl.rgb` must include the leading `#`. We
  documented this in the BUILD_PLAN risks block; M13 lessons confirm
  it.
- **Evaluator needs a SEEDED note, not a `{}` note.** The plugin's
  `extractSnapshot('{}'...)` succeeds on `{}` (valid JSON, valid object)
  and the editor loads an empty Univer workbook — bypassing
  `emptySnapshot()` entirely. The harness needs a note whose body is
  `wrapSnapshot(emptySnapshot())`. We added
  `scripts/pge/create-seeded-notesheet.js` for that; it duplicates
  the seed shape, which is intentional coupling (the harness is
  allowed to know what the runtime does).
- **CDP page picker.** Joplin's CDP exposes 4-5 pages: a DevTools
  page, plugin sandboxes (one per loaded plugin including ours), and
  the editor. eval-screenshot.js scores by URL/title; editor wins
  unambiguously (16 vs 11/0/0).
- **`waitForUniverRender` falls back to a 5s sleep.** None of
  `.univer-render-canvas`, `canvas.univer-render-canvas`,
  `#joplin-plugin-content`, `.univer-container` matched in the smoke
  capture but the screenshot still showed Univer rendered. Pick a
  stable selector once we have Univer DevTools open and a known-good
  fixture. This is a documented gap in eval-screenshot.js, not a
  blocker.
- **Pre-existing `tests/exportTableRoundTrip.test.ts:334` typecheck
  bug** — `'dashed'` is not in exceljs `BorderStyle` enum. Changed
  to `'mediumDashed'` (with matching assertion update on line 349)
  during this session because webpack's TS check blocks .jpl build.
  This was unrelated to smoke; the smoke didn't introduce it.
